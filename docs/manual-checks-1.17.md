# Manual checks for 1.17

Things unit tests cannot cover (a running app, real models). Each feature appends its own section.

## Regenerate Note (Vikunja #2947)

Needs a signed or Debug build of the real app; do NOT run it alongside your daily Distavo (they share one config and data folder).

1. Menu bar -> **Regenerate Note…** opens the window listing the 15 newest notes; the newest note with a saved transcript is preselected, notes without one are labelled "(no saved transcript)" and cannot be run.
2. Pick **Facts first** (or Classic), leave backend "As in Settings", add the instruction "Put the action items first", press **Regenerate**.
3. Open the activity log (menu -> Activity -> Open full log…): it must say `Regenerating note for <base> (transcript reused)` and then `Regenerated note: …`. It must NOT contain any converting/transcribing/language-detection/model-loading-for-transcription line.
4. In the notes folder: `<base>.md` is the new note and `<base>.prev-<yyyyMMdd-HHmmss>.md` holds the old one. Regenerate again: a second `.prev-…` file appears, the first is untouched.
5. The menu's **Open last note** opens the new note; **Compare…** does not list the `.prev-` file as a variant.
6. Stop Ollama (or point the server URL at a dead host, local fallback off) and regenerate: a "Note not regenerated" notification appears, the note is unchanged, no new `.prev-` file, and the "recordings failed" line does not appear in the menu.
7. Delete `<base>.transcript.clean.txt` from `~/Library/Application Support/Distavo/work` and open the window: that note is greyed out as "no saved transcript".
8. With on-device summaries enabled: choose **Built-in (this Mac)** and a long instruction; the note is written (or the error says why) and the previous note is kept.
9. Start a scan (drop a recording) and press Regenerate while it runs: the regenerate waits for the scan to finish (single-flight), it never overlaps.

Not exercised by unit tests: the SwiftUI window, notifications, the real Ollama / Foundation Models / Gemma paths with a custom instruction.

Notes made before this version regenerate fine as long as the work folder still holds `<base>.transcript.clean.txt` (every note the pipeline has written since the transcript cache was introduced); notes whose work folder was cleared, or imported without processing, cannot be regenerated.
